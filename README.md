# Deep_Learnning_implementation

This code is the result of the work done in the "Advanced Deep Learning" course by professor [Reinel Tabares Soto](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=_8F9RPQAAAAJ&hl=es)

Point 1

Carry out a Transfer Learning process from an architecture chosen by the student that has been trained with the MNIST (digit classification) or Fashion-MNIST (clothing classification). The goal is to transfer the weights exclusively from the convolutional layers and restructure the fully connected layer (according to the student's discretion). For convolutional layers perform different tests regarding whether the layers are left trainable or untrainable until satisfactory results are obtained.

Point 2

Generate a multimodal architecture with 3 branches, the first is a 2D convolutional architecture of the student's choice, the second branch is the Transfer Learning architecture from the previous point with the non-trainable convolutional layers and the third branch is the vectorized image (1D) using 1D convolutions according to the student's criteria. Then the features generated by the outputs of the 3 branches must be concatenated to send to an architecture of fully connected layers designed by the student.

Point 3

Take the last convolutional layer of the previously TRAINED multimodal architecture and obtain the feature vector (Flatten) for the training images, then train with these features 5 classifiers (according to the student's criteria from Sklearn) from Machine Learning and then make the final prediction by vote.
